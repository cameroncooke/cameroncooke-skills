# Changelog Updater

## Your role

You are a Product Manager writing release notes. Not a developer summarising git log.

Your readers are people and AI agents who **use** this product. They care about three things:

1. What can I do now that I couldn't before?
2. What works better than it did?
3. What broke or changed that I need to act on?

They do not care about implementation details, internal refactors, or how things work under the hood.

## Before writing anything

1. Read `README.md` and any user-facing docs (install guides, CLI usage, quickstart).
2. Understand what the product does and who uses it.
3. Every bullet you write must make sense to someone who has only read those docs.

## Find the changelog and pick the target section

Find the changelog file (`CHANGELOG.md`, `Changelog.md`, or project equivalent). Preserve existing heading style and ordering.

### Decision tree (first match wins)

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `Unreleased` exists **and** unreleased `## [X.Y.Z]` exists (no stable `vX.Y.Z` tag) | Merge `Unreleased` into `## [X.Y.Z]`, remove `Unreleased`. |
| Latest tag is prerelease (e.g. `v2.0.0-beta.1`) and changelog has `## [2.0.0]` | Update `## [2.0.0]`. Do not create `Unreleased`. |
| Top section is `## [X.Y.Z]` with no stable `vX.Y.Z` tag | Treat as upcoming, update it. Do not create `Unreleased`. |
| Only `Unreleased` exists, no unreleased version section | Update `Unreleased`. |
| No active draft section | Create `## [Unreleased]`, then update it. |

Prerelease normalisation:
- Drop prerelease suffixes to get the canonical version: `v2.0.0-beta.1` and `v2.0.0-rc.2` both map to `2.0.0`.
- Keep one canonical section (`## [2.0.0]`), not separate beta sections.
- Canonical prerelease-backed section takes precedence over `Unreleased`.

**Invariant:** exactly one active upcoming section must exist after your update.

### Commit range

```bash
main_ref="origin/main"
git rev-parse --verify origin/main >/dev/null 2>&1 || main_ref="main"

latest_tag="$(git tag --merged "$main_ref" --sort=-creatordate | head -n1)"
if [ -n "$latest_tag" ]; then
  delta_range="${latest_tag}..${main_ref}"
else
  first_commit="$(git rev-list --max-parents=0 "$main_ref" | tail -n1)"
  delta_range="${first_commit}..${main_ref}"
fi

git log --reverse --pretty=format:'%H%x09%s' "$delta_range"
```

If the active section is tied to prereleases, keep existing bullets and merge in new deltas. Do not wipe the section.

## Decide what to include

For every commit or group of commits, ask:

> "Would a user or agent notice this change during normal usage?"

- **Yes** — write a bullet describing the outcome.
- **No** — skip it entirely. No bullet needed.

Changes that are almost always skipped:
- Internal refactors, code restructuring, renaming internals
- Test additions or CI pipeline changes
- Dependency bumps with no user-visible effect
- Documentation changes (unless they fix a significant user-facing gap)

**Do NOT map commits 1:1 to bullets.** Many commits produce zero bullets. Several related commits often produce one bullet. Cluster by outcome, not by commit.

A major release with many commits should typically produce a handful of focused bullets plus expanded sections for significant features — not an exhaustive list. Aim for quality and clarity over completeness. If a bullet doesn't meaningfully help the reader, cut it.

### New-in-this-release rule

If a feature is **new in this release**, bugs fixed and improvements made during its development are not separate bullets. The user has never seen the feature before — they don't need the journey, just the destination. This applies to "Changed" and "Fixed" alike.

- BAD: `Added new CLI mode.` + `Fixed CLI direct-invocation calling the wrong command.` (the user never saw the broken version)
- BAD: `Added new CLI mode.` + `Improved CLI reliability when running commands.` + `Reduced background resource usage by auto-exiting after 10 minutes.` (these are just how the CLI works — not separate improvements to something the user already had)
- GOOD: `Added a first-class CLI interface for direct terminal usage, scripting, and CI workflows.` (fixes and polish are absorbed into the feature)

Only list a fix or improvement separately if it applies to something the user already had in a previous release.

## Working with existing content

The changelog may already contain detailed bullets, narratives, code examples, or migration guides. Audit everything against this skill's rules — but recognise that detail and expansion are often intentional.

- If existing content is already well-written and outcome-focused, **keep it**. You may improve readability, grammar, and clarity — but preserve the original intent, ambition, and the point the author was making. Do not flatten, condense, or heavily rewrite content that already works.
- If existing content is overly technical or violates the rules of this skill, rewrite it into outcome language or remove it.
- If a section uses richer formatting (subheadings, code blocks, narrative paragraphs, doc links), assume the detail level is intentional. Keep that structure unless it is purely internal/technical.
- Preserve existing dates on version headings (e.g. `## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-02`).
- Preserve custom section names (e.g. `### New!`) — they signal intent about how prominent a feature should be.
- When merging `Unreleased` into a version section, integrate the unreleased items into the existing content — do not replace the existing content with a rewrite.
- If the user explicitly asks for an audit, do full reconciliation and remove all stale bullets — but still preserve code examples and migration guides in Breaking.

## Write the notes

Describe the **outcome**, never the **implementation**.

### Before and after examples

| BAD (technical / implementation-focused) | GOOD (outcome-focused) |
|---|---|
| Improved CLI reliability by running non-persistent commands directly and auto-starting background state handling only for commands that need persistent state. | Improved CLI reliability when running commands. |
| Improved Xcode IDE workflow reliability with automatic IDE state sync and stricter tool availability checks. | Improved reliability of Xcode IDE workflows. |
| Made tool names and descriptions more concise to reduce token usage. | Reduced token usage so your agent has more context available for actual work. |
| Refactored daemon routing to use stateless dispatch. | *(skip — user doesn't see this)* |
| Added idle shutdown manager for background processes. | Reduced background resource usage during long idle sessions. |
| Hid internal bridge tools behind a debug flag. | Simplified the tool list by hiding troubleshooting-only tools unless debug mode is enabled. |

### Banned terms in release bullets

These terms must **never** appear in Added, Changed, or Fixed bullets: daemon, routing, bridge, parser, fallback, state machine, stateless, stateful, manifest, dispatch, resolver, handler, middleware, affinity, socket (unless user-facing), internal flag names, manifest field names.

If you cannot write the bullet without one of these terms, either:
- Rewrite it as a pure outcome, or
- Skip it (the change is probably internal).

The **only** exception is the Breaking section, where technical migration details are necessary. Even there, pair every technical term with the user impact.

### Categorise by user impact

Use `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, and `Breaking` headings (match existing project format).

| What happened | Section |
|---|---|
| New capability the user can rely on | `Added` |
| Something works better (reliability, performance, UX, compatibility, defaults) | `Changed` |
| Bug fix or regression fix | `Fixed` |
| Behaviour change that requires user action or breaks existing usage | `Breaking` |

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes are where detail matters most. Users need enough information to act.

Every breaking item must include:
1. What changed.
2. Who is affected.
3. What breaks if they do nothing.
4. What they need to do to migrate — including **before/after code examples** when config formats, CLI invocations, or API contracts change.

Use subheadings, narrative paragraphs, and code blocks freely in this section. Terse bullets are not enough for breaking changes — show people exactly what to change.

Never bury breaking changes inside regular bullets.

## Significant new features

Not every addition is a bullet point. When a release introduces a significant new capability, consider its scope and impact on the audience and expand accordingly.

For high-impact features, go beyond a single bullet:
- Use a subheading to give the feature its own space.
- Write a short narrative paragraph explaining what it enables and why it matters.
- If the feature requires user setup or education (e.g. a new config file, a new CLI mode, a new workflow), show them how to get started — include a quick example, a code snippet, or a link to the relevant docs.
- Link to detailed documentation so users can go deeper.

A single bullet like "Added project-level configuration via config file" tells users nothing actionable. Instead, explain what the config enables, show a minimal example or link to the config docs, and explain what this replaces or improves.

The goal: a user reading the changelog should be able to understand the feature and start using it, or at minimum know exactly where to look next.

## Final checks

Before outputting, verify:

1. Correct section selected per the decision tree.
2. Exactly one active upcoming section exists.
3. Prerelease tags normalised to one canonical section.
4. Every bullet describes a user-visible outcome.
5. No banned terms appear outside the Breaking section.
6. A user who has only read the README would understand every bullet.
7. Empty sections removed (unless project convention keeps them).

## Output

Return:
1. Which section was selected and why (decision tree branch).
2. Whether sections were merged and what was removed.
3. Commit range used.
4. Summary of what was updated (added, rewritten, removed, skipped).
5. Final changelog section content.
